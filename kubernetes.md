# Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by [Google](https://google.com), it functions as a container orchestrator, managing groups of containers (pods) across clusters of machines to ensure high availability, self-healing, and efficient resource utilization.

### Key Features and Capabilities

- **Automation**: Automates container deployment and replication.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts failed containers, replaces them, and reschedules them when nodes die.
- **Scaling**: Scales applications up or down automatically based on demand.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes network traffic to maintain stable performance.
- **Storage Orchestration**: Mounts storage systems (local, public cloud) automatically.

### Core Components

- **Cluster**: A set of machines (nodes) that run containerized applications.
- **Control Plane**: The "brain" of Kubernetes that makes global decisions about the cluster.
- **Nodes**: Machines (virtual or physical) that run the application containers.
- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units, containing one or more containers.

### Cloud Providers

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Google's managed Kubernetes service.
- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**: Amazon's managed Kubernetes service.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Microsoft's managed Kubernetes service.
- **DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)**: DigitalOcean's managed Kubernetes service.
